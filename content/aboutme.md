Hi, my name is **Vladlen Gladis** and I'm originally from a [small town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Str%C4%83%C8%99eni) in Moldova, I've been working as a software engineer since 2016.

### My experience
One of my passions is mentoring and supporting other developers around me, and I believe that this is an
important part of being a successful software engineer. To further my knowledge and skills, I've
obtained several certifications, including an AWS Developer Certification, AWS Associate
Solution Architect Certification, and a Java Professional Certification.

### I'm interested in
I have a particular interest in **Java/Kotlin**, **Spring Ecosystem**, **Cloud architecture**, and I love teaching and reading about these technologies.
I've built a number of distributed and reliable solutions on AWS, and I find that dealing with complex software architectures is one of my favorite challenges.

### New steps
I am now making my mark in the tech world by starting to write my own blog posts. I hope that by sharing my experiences and expertise, I can help others who are just starting out in the field, or who are looking to improve their skills.
Thank you for taking the time to read a little bit about me! :v:
